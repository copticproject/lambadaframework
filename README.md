# Lambda REST Framework

Lambda rest framework is a REST framework that implements [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/)  API and lets you deploy your applications to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) in a serverless fashion. With Lambada you can migrate the existing JAX-RS applications with a very little effort and build scalable applications without having to deal with servers.

This project is a fork from Lambada Framework with the aim of simplifying the deployment process and using the existing proxy feature of AWS API Gateway calling AWS Lambda functions.

## Other projects

You might want to look at other projects about serverless architecture:

 - [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless): Reputable framework to deploy serverless projects in Node.JS
 - [ingenieux/lambada](https://github.com/ingenieux/lambada): Another JAVA framework with a similar name with Lambada Framework. It uses a slightly different approach than Lambada Framework to develop serverless projects.
 - [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa): Develop and deploy serverless applications with Python.
